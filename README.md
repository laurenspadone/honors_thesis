The choice of diagnostic categories for a disease (e.g. genetic epilepsy or asthma) depends, in part, on the statistical procedures that govern the analysis that leads to a clinical determination. Often logistic regression underlies the classification approach. These regression models are generally based on distinct categories having either a strict order (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) or no ordered structure at all. However, many diseases do not fall into one of these two simple schemes. Recent work has started to provide a methodological framework for the statistical analysis of partially ordered classification models. My thesis will give a more rigorous understanding of this newer approach and to provide an R package that is user friendly to clinicians.
